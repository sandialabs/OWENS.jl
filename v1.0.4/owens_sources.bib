@article{swift_characteristics,
	abstractnote = {Historical meteorological tall tower data are analyzed from the Texas Tech University 200 m tower to characterize the atmospheric trends of the Scaled Wind Farm Technologies (SWiFT) site. In this report the data are analyzed to reveal bulk atmospheric trends, temporal trends and correlations of atmospheric variables. Through this analysis for the SWiFT turbines the site International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) classification is determined to be class III-C. Averages and distributions of atmospheric variables are shown, revealing large fluctuations and the importance of understanding the actual site trends as opposed to simply using averages. The site is significantly directional with the average wind speed from the south, and particularly so in summer and fall. Site temporal trends are analyzed from both seasonal (time of the year) to daily (hour of the day) perspectives. Atmospheric stability is seen to vary most with time of day and less with time of year. Turbulence intensity is highly correlated with stability, and typical daytime unstable conditions see double the level of turbulence intensity versus that experienced during the average stable night. Shear, veer and atmospheric stability correlations are shown, where shear and veer are both highest for stable atmospheric conditions. An analysis of the Texas Tech University tower anemometer measurements is performed which reveals the extent of the tower shadow effects and sonic tilt misalignment.},

@article{2021MooreOWENSAero,
	abstract = { Vertical-axis wind turbines' simpler design and low center of gravity make them ideal for floating wind applications. However, efficient design optimization of floating systems requires fast and accurate models. Low-fidelity vertical-axis turbine aerodynamic models, including double multiple streamtube and actuator cylinder theory, were created during the 1980s. Commercial development of vertical-axis turbines all but ceased in the 1990s until around 2010 when interest resurged for floating applications. Despite the age of these models, the original assumptions (2-D, rigid, steady, straight bladed) have not been revisited in full. When the current low-fidelity formulations are applied to modern turbines in the unsteady domain, aerodynamic load errors nearing 50\% are found, consistent with prior literature. However, a set of steady and unsteady modifications that remove the majority of error is identified, limiting it near 5\%. This paper shows how to reformulate the steady models to allow for unsteady inputs including turbulence, deforming blades, and variable rotational speed. A new unsteady approximation that increases numerical speed by 5--10× is also presented. Combined, these modifications enable full-turbine unsteady simulations with accuracy comparable to higher-fidelity vortex methods, but over 5000× faster. },

GEBT is based on the mixed formulation of the geometric exact beam theory which can capture all geometric nonlinearities due to large deflections and rotations, subject to the strains being small. Coupled with Variational Beam Sectional Analysis (VABS), a general-purpose cross-sectional analysis, GEBT can effectively analyze geometric nonlinear behavior of slender structures having arbitrary cross-sections made of arbitrary materials.},

Four turbines were produced; three are installed and are operable at (1) the Wind Systems Test Center, Rocky Flats, Colorado; (2) the US Department of Agriculture Conservation and Production Research Center at Bushland, Texas; and (3) Tisbury Water Authority, Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard. The fourth turbine is stored at Bushland, Texas, awaiting selection of an erection site. Technical direction was provided to Alcoa by Sandia National Laboratories. Contract results are documented in this report (SAND82-7113) and in the Phase I Technical Report (ALO-4272), both of which are available through NTIS.},
