    "Got access to HPC via webCARS capacity clusters, simple ssh kevmoor@skybridge and kerb pass via git bash (which is just mingw).  May be good to switch to linux for local development.  Great that they are using slurm!  I may have also had to get access to matlab coder license via NILE.\n",

Would obviously use cmake for better compiling of more complex programs.  Didn't use srun to get slurm to give me actual compute time a resources.  Would need to do that, or sbatch for a auto batch run if we were running anything for real/substantial.\n",

    "So, the matlab coder utility can output both source and executables, but were compiler issues right out of the box, which in my experience is typical for windows systems.  The code output for the simple function worked well enough for c and c++ output.  I turned off all of the overhead type things to make to code simpler and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now switching to the application compiler: I had issues trying to get it to create an installer with the runtime included.  I installed the runtime from NILE, but after a half hour of trying to get it to connect up, I stopped.  I'm sure it can be done, just isn't obvious to me.  The web installer works just fine and does output prebuilt executables as well, which run, but there is a lot of overhead time for it to start.  My simple function just output a few things to the terminal, so I couldn't just double click the executable, I had to run it from the terminal to see the output.\n",

    "Now trying to run the version of OWENS I have through these tools:  Using the code generation readiness utility (right click a function and at the bottom), it said that the following were unsupported: fscanf, ismembc, str2num, warning, readtable. When I fixed those, and the syntax errors, it didn't like variable length arrays and made me pre-allocate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, since I don't have a driver for OWENS with the proper input files yet, I switched to Brandon's blade optimization.  It had 889 unsupported Function calls, from regexp, to cd, to sscanf, to warning, to clc, and lots and lots of others.  So, I switched to the application compiler and it did compile (different than the C++ compilation, the application compiler requires the matlab runtime overhead).  Butâ€¦ it didn't run, error message says that Matlab compiler doesn't support modifying the search path, and I'd expect other errors would come up after that is fixed.  So, it's going to take a non-trivial amount of work to get this code ready for the matlab converter.  Likely can be done in-stride with the other development, but will need to be deliberate from the start.  If we have <10 auto check issues in OWENS now, but over 800 in the other optimization code, it sounds like we should definitely start going in the right direction NOW.  \n",

    "Also, during my reading, it appears that matlab can compile binaries for other operating systems, but that it needs to be compiled from the target system (i.e. run the matlab compiler on a mac for a mac binary).  Another interesting thing was that the compiled matlab (according to the tutorials) isn't necessarily going to be faster than the interpreted matlab.  The c code may be faster, but may be due in part to the changes required to get matlab to spit out the code.\n",

    "Finally got it to create the source code, 91 commits later, each with some sort of restructuring/typsetting.  About 30% was done with the regular matlab editor suggestions, another 70% with the coder GUI in matlab, and the last 10% post compilation via mex (built into the coder GUI).  The most difficult issues to figure out were also in the 70% chunck.  Basically, you have to code as if you were coding in C++: declare your variables, and don't change their types or sizes after they are declared.  You can have variable size arrays, variable at the time of initialization.  I haven't played with it, but it appears that even that can be shut off for speed in the coder settings.  It is really frustrating to do this in matlab since whenever you make a mistake (like accidently creating a row vector instead of a column vector), it just plows through the rest of the program and resizes/retypes everything without telling you.  For this reason, it is my opinion that matlab is a terrible development tool. It incentivizes terrible coding practice, with and emphasis on matrix based syntax, opposite to any HPC code.  It is 2x slower with code optimized for matlab, then 1000x slower for code written to satisfy the coder requirements, also further incentivizing the wrong direction.  So you have to essentially write obtrusive matlab code, making up tons of sub functions to try to recapture the 60% of capability you loose in conforming with the coder requirements, then you have to generate the C++ code, and then compile it.  Why not just start with julia, retain 100% of your functionality, and have it run on HPC resources out of the box, and optimize your code as needed?  Good luck optimizing the C++ output of matlab.\n",

If that effort were put towards translating into Julia, it would have likely taken less effort, and given a likely 2x or more speedup.  Why less effort?  Julia syntax is very similar to matlab, and julia will warn you before bulldozing through the code redefining all of your types and sizes.  For the VAWT AC code, it took me less than 8 hours to translate the code, then 2x that again to find the handful of array orientation mistakes made during the translation (since matlab 1D arrays are typically column vectors instead of row vectors, and zeros(5) makes a 5x5 instead of a straight 5 array of zeros, etc).  The owens repository I got to run C code is 12110 lines of code long.

This isn't the case for the dominant modes though, since the eigs residual is much lower (eigs 1e-16 and eig 1e-10).  So the differing methods don't match, and then when we compile the code and run it, there is some similarity in the numbers, but some of them are still way off.  So, I vote that since I've spent over 2 days on this single particular problem, and it appears to be rooted in the eigen solve, I move on and leave these thoughts for when we come back to it.

Used the julia matlab direct interface, got me up and running in no time, and I was even surprised when looking at the unit test outputs that the reaction forces (which were the only part of the analysis changed by swapping out the aero) were remarkably similar.
