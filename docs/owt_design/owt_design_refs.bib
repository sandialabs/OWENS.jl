Especially floating foundations which have a great potential for offshore wind farms in water depths between 40 m up to 200 m and more, will be a major factor. The objective of this paper is to focus on the design of a TLP substructure including the anchoring in the seabed by considering the economic and ecological aspects. One main focus is on economic challenges and the approaches for reduction of the investment costs and the Levelized Cost of Energy. A second focus is on the cumulative energy demand as well on the expected CO2-emissions during the fabrication process.},

  abstract  = {Breaking the dependence on fossil fuels offers many opportunities for strengthened competitiveness, technological development and progress. Offshore wind power is a domestic, sustainable and largely untapped energy resource that provides an alternative to fossil fuels, reduces carbon emissions, and decreases the economic and supply risks associated with reliance on imported fuels. Today, the modern offshore wind turbine offers competitive production prices for renewable energy and is therefore a key technology in achieving the energy and climate goals of the future. The overall aim of this Ph.D. thesis was to enable low-cost and low-risk support structures to be designed in order to improve the economic feasibility of future offshore wind farms. The research work was divided in the following four selected research topics in the field of geotechnical engineering, relating to the monopile and the bucket foundation concepts:1. Long-term response of monopiles2. Modelling of advanced geotechnical problems3. Interpretation of piezocones in silt4. Buckling loads of bucket foundationsThe outcomes of each of the four research topics contribute, either directly or indirectly, to enable low-cost and low-risk support structures to be put into use. Overall, these outcomes are an important contribution to increase the economic feasibility of future offshore wind farms.},

  abstract = {{It is of interest to investigate the potential advantages of floating vertical axis wind turbine (FVAWT) due to its economical installation and maintenance. A novel 5MW vertical axis wind turbine concept with a Darrieus rotor mounted on a semi-submersible support structure is proposed in this paper. In order to assess the technical and economic feasibility of this novel concept, a comprehensive simulation tool for modeling of the floating vertical axis wind turbine is needed.This work presents the development of a coupled method for modeling of the dynamics of a floating vertical axis wind turbine. This integrated dynamic model takes into account the wind inflow, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, structural dynamics (wind turbine, floating platform and the mooring lines) and a generator control. This approach calculates dynamic equilibrium at each time step and takes account of the interaction between the rotor dynamics, platform motion and mooring dynamics. Verification of this method is made through model-to-model comparisons. Finally, some dynamic response results for the platform motion are presented as an example for application of this method.}},

Two models, Model 1 and Model 2, are created aiming at developing a computational tool to handle hydro-dynamic and structural aspects together to help the TLP designer. Another objective is to generate relevant information for a non-linear static local stress analysis of TLP components from a dynamic hydro-structural global analysis. Model 2 is developed for LUSAS, a general purpose, well established, FE software, to validate the in-house program DCATLP. Model 1 and Model 2 are purposely made slightly different in the tether modelling so that the non-linear formulations in DCATLP to treat a TLP as a coupled system with the hull and tethers can be verified with a straightforward linear step-by-step dynamic analysis in LUSAS. The code in DCATLP has advanced features to account for some complex aspects of TLPs, such as compliant characteristics. The results from DCATLP can be directly used in the reliability based structural design of TLP components and subsequent optimisation studies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new frequency domain modeling approach for floating offshore wind turbines with coupled wind turbine, floating platform, and mooring system sub-models. The sub-models are generated using the validated numerical tools FAST and WAMIT to obtain the frequency domain aerodynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics, respectively, for any given design candidate. The turbulent wind and irregular wave loads are incorporated in the frequency domain model using wind and wave power spectral density functions, the JONSWAP and Kaimal spectra, respectively. To validate the proposed 6 DOF frequency domain framework across standard operational environmental conditions, predicted system responses of a 5 MW NREL offshore wind turbine with three classes of reference platforms including the OC3-Hywind, the MIT/NREL TLP, and the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible were compared to the outputs of 6 DOF and 22 DOF FAST time domain simulations. The comparison over an aggregate of eleven environmental conditions focused on differences in predicted platform rigid body motions and structural considerations including platform surge, roll, and pitch, and rotor thrust, total blade root and tower base bending moments/fatigue loads, fairlead and anchor tensions/fatigue loads. In terms of platform motions, the worst match of frequency and time domain model predictions was seen for the OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible with errors of 13.2% in peak displacement values. The frequency domain model predictions of rotor thrust, blade root and tower base bending moments demonstrated the largest error in the case of the OC3-Hywind spar buoy with the peak loads differing by up to 12.8%. Errors in the predictions of maximum fairlead and anchor tensions were less than 11.5% with maximum error occurring for the MIT/NREL TLP. In terms of fatigue load comparison, the blade root and tower base fatigue load predictions showed less than 9.8% errors for all the reference platforms. Comparison of the fairlead and anchor fatigue loads showed that errors were less than 13.8% with the largest error seen for the OC3-Hywind spar buoy platform. Overall, the frequency domain model provides reliable means for assessing platforms dynamics at the conceptual stage of the design process.},
