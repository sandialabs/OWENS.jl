# # [Simply Running OWENS](@id simple1)
# 
# In this example, we show the first level of what is going on behind the precompiled binary
# Running julia directly with this as a starting point could make things like automating many runs in 
# a way that is not compatible with the current interface, but your design design fits.
#
# OWENS is comprised of many building blocks.  These series of examples progressively shows the internals
# of several of the key building blocks a new user might employ for their projects.  Fundamentally, OWENS has been 
# built to be as generalizable as possible. The lowest level of building blocks enable this, however, there are many
# common use cases for which helper functions have been developed, such as for meshing certain standard architectures
# and calculating and applying sectional properties to these architectures. The figure below summarizes this at a high 
# level.

# Here is an example of using the same model against the automated DLC run script. TODO: issue with CI version of turbsim
# Note that for a setup cutom to a specific design, you'll want to go to the B level to get all of the detailed inputs correct
# One of these is the controller where a discon controller library can be coupled instead of the specified RPM control.
